    ### Key Cybersecurity Threats
    1. **Malware**: This includes various forms of malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware that can infiltrate systems to steal data, disrupt operations, or demand ransom for data recovery.

    2. **Phishing Attacks**: Cybercriminals use deceptive emails and messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, often leading to identity theft or financial loss.

    3. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**: These attacks overwhelm a system or network with traffic, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users, which can disrupt business operations and lead to significant financial losses.

    4. **Social Engineering**: This involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information by exploiting psychological tactics, often leading to unauthorized access to systems or data.

    5. **Emerging Threats from AI and Quantum Computing**: As technology evolves, new threats such as AI-enabled attacks and vulnerabilities associated with quantum computing are emerging, posing significant risks to cybersecurity.
