COMPETING NARRATIVES OF THE CRISIS

A Welcome and Introduction from Andrew W. Lo

WELCOME

It is a pleasure and an honor for me to welcome
you to this companion volume to the 2008
Financial Crisis: A Ten-Year Review, a confer-
ence that took place on 8-9 November 2018 at
the NYU Stern School of Business in New York
City. All of the key stakeholders related to the
2008 crisis were represented at this historic
gathering. To quote Lin-Manuel Miranda, we
had all the folks “who were in the room where
it happened.” Alas, I was not even in the hall-
way connected to the room outside the room
where it happened, so I was thrilled to be able to
hear from these individuals, and in these pages
and at www.annualreviews.org/page/financial-
conference-livestream, you can hear from them
too.!

ABOUT ANNUAL REVIEWS

I want to begin with some background on what
gave us the impetus to create this event and vol-
ume and what it has to do with Annual Reviews.

Annual Reviews is an organization that most
of you, I suspect, have not heard of. It is a non-
profit organization that was started in 1932,
originally to provide a summary review of pub-
lished research in biochemistry. So, the very
first Annual Review was the Annual Review of
Biochemistry, published once a year, as its title
suggests. It consisted of review articles that were
curated by the editors and the editorial board

1Conference videos also available at www.cfainstitute.org/
research/foundation/2008-financial-crisis.

to summarize and synthesize all the things that
were going on in that field at that time, a very
fast-moving field that has only gotten faster, as
you can imagine. Since then, Annual Reviews
has grown to a family of 51 different titles
across a wide range of disciplines, including the
Annual Review of Financial Economics, which
Bob Merton and I co-edit.

The idea behind these reviews is crowdsourcing,
but crowdsourcing of a very specific kind—
bringing together a variety of research topics
and distilling them into more digestible narra-
tives. In particular, the focus is on topics that
move very quickly, where it is just not possible
for any one individual to keep up with all of the
relevant research in that field.

But it is not the intention of Annual Reviews to
be a collection of book reports. The reviews do
not just summarize research; they also provide
interpretation. This is the difference between
data and information. The co-editor of the
Annual Review of Psychology, Susan Fiske, calls
this approach “reviews with attitude” We want
authors to use their own perspectives to shape
the narratives that are summarized by their
reviews.

In this endeavor, the editorial board members
play a critical role. Our amazing editorial board
helps us to commission the reviews, identifying
the key experts in the field to distill the many
different research ideas in their areas of exper-
tise and refereeing the contributions to ensure
that they meet the highest standards of schol-
arship as well as relevance. In addition to the

COMPETING NARRATIVES OF THE CRISIS

editorial board members, we have the support
of the entire Annual Reviews organization, an
extremely effective group of professionals that
allows us editors and authors to focus solely on
ideas and exposition rather than production or
administration. They are the heart and soul of
Annual Reviews across all 51 disciplines.

Volume 1 of the Annual Review of Financial
Economics was published in 2009, a decade ago.
It was a rather strange period in which to launch
a review journal of finance; a few interesting
things happened that year and the year before.
Our inaugural volume was born in the context
of crisis. At that time, we were concerned about
what the public reception to an Annual Review
of Financial Economics would be. Finance
was getting dragged through the mud. But we
decided that it was the perfect time to launch
because what the crisis indicated was the need
for more knowledge about finance, not less.

A TWENTY-ONE-BOOK
BOOK REVIEW

Shortly after that first volume was published,
I was contacted by the editor of the Journal of
Economic Literature and invited to write a book
review about the crisis, and I was allowed to pick
my favorite book on the subject. | initially chose
The Squam Lake Report, the product of a group of
15 leading finance and macro economists whom
I respected greatly, who sequestered themselves
in a New Hampshire resort for several days to
formulate their own narrative of the crisis.

But I soon realized that this book did not cap-
ture a number of aspects of the crisis, including
the broader historical context. I then turned to
Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff’s wonderful
book, This Time Is Different, an 800-year his-
tory of financial crises. After reading that book,
I realized that certain institutional features

2 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

about the financial system were missing, so I
sought out other books about the crisis.

After a couple of years of reading, the journal
editor finally ran out of patience and said I had
to submit my review at that time or the jour-
nal would have to move on to another topic.
I relented and submitted my book review:
“Reading about the Financial Crisis: A Twenty-
One-Book Review” After all that reading, I was
unable to uncover the truth; instead, I came
upon at least 21 different truths.

SOME NARRATIVES
REGARDING THE CRISIS

Here are some narratives that I came across:

e The crisis was all about subprime mort-
gage lending. It was the subprime borrow-
ers who really caused the crisis, and it was
a combination of government policies—the
Community Reinvestment Act and lower
lending standards—that ultimately caused
these subprime borrowers to start default-
ing at massively higher rates than the rest of
the population.

e Bankers were at fault, too, because they did
not have enough skin in the game. They
were playing with house money, and they
weren't as involved as they should be in the
risk bearing.

e Nobody saw the crisis coming, and if there
were any issues regarding the theoreti-
cal framework around the crisis, it was the
efficient market hypothesis. People had an
utter devotion to market efficiency, which is
what caused the crisis.

e And finally, changes in SEC regulation
allowed huge increases in leverage among
the investment banks.


COMPETING NARRATIVES OF THE CRISIS

Have you come across at least one of these nar-
ratives? Do you believe at least one of these
narratives? It turns out that every one of these
narratives can be challenged by hard facts and
data, as the articles in this volume will show.

BUSTING A NARRATIVE

To whet the appetite, let me describe one
article's contributions as an example of what
Annual Reviews is all about. Manuel Adelino,
Antoinette Schoar, and Felipe Severino’s won-
derful contribution exemplifies the key charac-
teristics of an Annual Reviews article and why
such reviews are important. The title of their
review is “The Role of Housing and Mortgage
Markets in the Financial Crisis,’ and the authors
take on the critical question of what was, in fact,
at the root of the crisis. Was it the subprime
borrowers whom many pundits blame?

The authors begin their review with a question
about mortgage leverage. Did mortgage lever-
age increase during the crisis period? Yes, it
did—lots more mortgages, lots more leverage.
To reach this conclusion, the authors distill a
number of articles from various authors to con-
struct their own particular narrative. How did
lending standards change in the boom? Was it
true that we lowered our lending standards dra-
matically? You can learn what the authors dis-
covered by reading their article, but let me just
say that you will be quite surprised at what the
evidence shows.

What about homeownership expansion among
the lower middle class? Did the Community
Reinvestment Act really increase homeowner-
ship widely in the post-2000 period? And was
that the cause of the crisis?

Many articles have been published on this one
question, and Adelino, Schoar, and Severino
provide a number of citations to that literature.

Once more, they bust another myth. And if you
are curious as to what the data show, they pro-
vide a number of tables and figures to support
their narratives, which can be easily accessed
online through the Annual Reviews portal.”

And finally, they take on the question of mort-
gage defaults. Were the defaults concentrated
in the lower middle class? Was it the subprime
loans that were at fault? And again, the answer
that they provide is absolutely shocking. This
answer is not just a matter for academics to
debate. It has great impact on policy. They show
that the popular narrative—a narrative on which
policy has been and is currently being based—is
just not true.

To support their narrative, the authors provide
a list of 93 references to the literature. Unlike
many other journals in which authors include
a large number of references just to pander to
referees, Annual Reviews articles contain only
those references that are cited in the main
body of the text. Moreover, in the online ver-
sion, there are links to each reference that bring
readers to the specific passages of the review in
which those citations appear, greatly increasing
the efficiency with which readers can link key
concepts to their sources.

THE DARWINIAN PROCESS
OF SIFTING IDEAS

The point of Annual Reviews is to bring together
the very best thinking, but with an attitude, with
specific narratives about how all these pieces fit
together. Unlike my book review of 21 books
about the crisis that came to no conclusion, the
review articles contained in this volume all have
conclusions. And plenty of attitude.

financial-110217-023036.

COMPETING NARRATIVES OF THE CRISIS

Are they the correct conclusions? At this point,
the jury is still out. But there is no doubt that,
in Bob Merton’s and my opinion, these articles
represent some of the best thinking we have
today. But the thinking is constantly changing,
which is one of the greatest features of Annual
Reviews. It is a Darwinian process where only
the very best and most compelling arguments
survive.

Does it mean the surviving arguments are
always correct? Certainly not. But the interest-
ing thing about academia—for those readers
who are not part of our world—is that there are
two ways that you can make a name for yourself
in academia. You can come up with a brilliant
theory, or you can destroy somebody else’s bril-
liant theory. Both are perfectly acceptable paths
for career advancement, and that Darwinian
process is highlighted and facilitated by Annual
Reviews.

So, fast-forward to the 10th volume of the
Annual Review of Financial Economics in 2018.
We now have 10 articles about the financial cri-
sis, each of them as thorough, detailed, and full

4 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

of attitude as Adelino, Schoar, and Severino’s.
There have been a number of conferences mark-
ing the 10th anniversary of the 2008 financial
crisis, but the gathering on which this volume
is based is unique. What we bring to the table,
in addition to the people who were in the room
where it happened, are the academics with the
greatest insights into what happened, how it
happened, why it happened—and, maybe, just
possibly, what we might be able to do to make
sure it doesn’t happen again.

Only by understanding narrative in a materi-
ally different and substantive way, by pushing
aside the politics and polemics, and by focus-
ing instead on the underlying drivers—crowd-
sourced through this laborious process of sifting
through thousands, if not tens of thousands, of
articles—can we learn how to avoid crises in the
future.

DEGLOBALIZATION: THE RISE OF
DISEMBEDDED UNILATERALISM

Presented by Harold James
Summarized by Laurence B. Siegel

Although globalization continues to domi-
nate popular discussion, there is evidence of
deglobalization—a decrease in international
trade, cross-border investing, and so forth—
in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.
Moreover, deglobalization is much more preva-
lent in political discourse, which has coalesced
around nationalism and populism, than in
actual economic behavior.

Embedded globalism characterizes the set of
institutions that arose from and reflect the lib-
eral tendency of the long period from the end
of World War II to the global financial cri-
sis. It is marked by international agreements,
such as Bretton Woods; government regula-
tions, such as trade law; international public
regulatory authorities, such as the International
Organization of Securities Commissions; and
private standard setters with global reach.

The opposite of embedded globalism can be
labeled disembedded unilateralism. It is char-
acterized by opposition to free trade, calls for
stricter limits on immigration, and an “America
First” attitude (or its equivalent in other
countries).

The KOF index of global integration, con-
structed by the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), rose for

all five economic superpowers (United States,
China, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan)
from 1970 to about 2000, then leveled off in the
United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.
Japan continued to integrate, and so did China,
but less rapidly. The failure of integration to
continue to increase does not, in itself, indicate
a decline, but it could foreshadow one if current
political trends continue.

Empirical evidence of deglobalization includes a
decline in cross-border bank claims, a low (but
still positive) rate of import growth, an increase
in harmful trade measures, and the slowing of
international migration.

The current political atmosphere seems to
believe, wrongly, that economic life is zero-sum.
Trade wars, proposed border walls, and Brexit
all point in this direction. The dominant center-
right and center-left parties that have ruled
much of the world since the end of World War
II have become either powerless (Hungary) or
unpopular (France), or they have morphed into
non-traditional parties (Trump Republicans
in the United States, Corbyn Labourites in the
United Kingdom).

To quote Game of Thrones, “Winter is coming”
Efforts to dismantle globalization, however, may
paradoxically lead to its reform and renaissance.

FINANCIAL CRISES

Presented by Gary Gorton
Summarized by Laurence B. Siegel

We are accustomed to thinking of banks as “tak-
ing deposits” and then investing the money at a
rate of return higher than the rate paid to the
depositors, thus making a profit. But we can
turn this around and look at short-term debt
as the bank’s only product. Moreover, this debt
has the special characteristic of being “informa-
tion insensitive” —that is, no private information
is needed to evaluate it. It’s widely understood
to be riskless. When you worry whether a check
you are cashing is “good,’ the concern is about
whether the depositor has sufficient funds, not
whether the bank does. It does. And, just in case
it doesn’t, it is backed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

In other words, banks are the source of what we
loosely call “money.” When owners of money
(ie, depositors, or creditors of banks) grow
concerned that they will be unable to access it,
depositors engage in a bank run, transactions
freeze up, and economic output can plunge. A
financial crisis, then, is an information event
in which holders of short-term debt observe a
public signal and, in response, no longer want
to lend to banks because they have reason to
suspect the backing for the debt. In a financial
crisis, the information-insensitive debt becomes
information sensitive.

For this reason, financial crises occur even
in advanced economies and are caused by
virtue of the fact that we have banks at all.
(Almost by definition, banks engage in maturity

6 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

transformation—that is, they borrow for the
short term and lend for the long term. This
disparity is the underlying source of the risk
of banks.) Thus, financial crises have occurred
with some regularity throughout history, with
1940-1975 being the longest exception.

The 2008 global financial crisis can be analyzed
in this context. The shadow banking system,
in which repos (repurchase agreements) were
money, had become important by 2007. An
instrument can serve as money only if it is per-
ceived as extremely secure, and repos backed
by mortgages and other risky assets (that had
been repackaged to appear safe) became sus-
pect because of both the decline in real estate
prices and increases in mortgage default rates.
Thus, the repo market was at the center of the
crisis, although one had to be on a trading floor
to notice this.

Financial crises tend to coincide with business-
cycle peaks. Moreover, they have profound
implications for macroeconomics. The crises
of 2007-2009 showed that market economies
remain susceptible to collapse or near-collapse
in a financial crisis. The vulnerability of short-
term debt, in all its forms, is an inherent feature
of market economies because maturity mis-
match is an inherent feature of banks, which
are necessary for market economies to function.
Thus, financial crises have occurred in market
economies throughout history.


RECENT RESEARCH ON BANKS'
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND
FINANCIAL STABILITY

Presented by Stephen G. Ryan

Summarized by Luis Garcia-Feijoo, CFA, CIPM

Recent research indicates that banks’ financial
reporting may affect financial stability through
its impact on the following three channels: the
likelihood of capital requirement violations,
banks’ internal discipline over risk management
and control systems, and the external discipline
of the market and regulators over banks.

Regarding capital requirement violations, recent
work has examined US regulators’ removal
of the accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI) prudential filter from advanced
approaches banks (i.e., very large banks). AOCI
is a component of owners’ equity that includes
cumulative gains and losses on securities clas-
sified as available for sale (AFS), but it does not
include cumulative gains and losses on securi-
ties classified as held to maturity (HTM). With
the AOCI filter in place, the definition of regu-
latory capital excludes AOCI, and so banks
have no incentive to classify securities as HTM
rather than AFS. Basel III and US regulations,
however, removed the AOCI filter beginning
January 2014. Recent research has found that
inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on AFS
securities increases the volatility of regulatory
capital and hence the likelihood of violations.
Thus, removal of the filter has created an incen-
tive for banks to classify securities as HTM
rather than AFS.

Additionally, firms may sell AFS securities with-
out constraint, but they cannot generally sell
or reclassify HTM securities without reclas-
sifying the entire portfolio of HTM securities.
This dynamic creates accounting frictions,
because it limits banks’ ability to sell securities
to raise funds. Moreover, banks cannot obtain
hedge accounting for the interest rate risk of
HTM securities, which creates another fric-
tion. Research indicates these frictions have
economic consequences. Specifically, banks
have reduced the risk of both HTM and AFS
securities, relied more on borrowing through
repurchase agreements that potentially can be
collateralized by HTM securities, reduced their
loans overall, and increased the risk of their
loans. These consequences are unlikely to pro-
mote financial stability.

Regarding the banks’ internal discipline and the
market's external discipline, financial report-
ing requirements may lead to better modeling
of risk exposures and increased transparency,
improving discipline. For example, recent work
has examined property casualty (PC) insurers’
fair value accounting and life insurers’ amortized
cost accounting for investment securities that
are non-investment grade but not yet in default.
Researchers found that property and casualty
insurers record timelier other-than-temporary

RECENT RESEARCH ON BANKS’ FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FINANCIAL STABILITY

impairments of these securities than do life
insurers. This finding and others in the litera-
ture reflect the notion that fair value measure-
ment leads insurers to develop risk models and
control systems that enhance the companies’
internal discipline, thereby promoting financial
stability.

Furthermore, researchers have found that
banks affected by stronger loan-level disclosure

8 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

requirements increase banks’ external disci-
pline. In turn, this increase leads to better-
quality loans, increased credit supply, and
timelier loss provisions.

The recent research has used methods that
address issues of causal inference (e.g., differ-
ences in differences). Collectively, the research
identifies important channels through which
financial reporting affects financial stability.


DEREGULATING WALL STREET

Presented by Matthew Richardson, Kermit L. Schoenholtz,

and Lawrence J. White

Summarized by Luis Garcia-Feijéo, CFA, CIPM

An individual firm’s systemic risk relates to
how this firm contributes to aggregate capital
and liquidity shortfalls in the financial system.
A firm’s optimal leverage might aggregate to
too much leverage for the financial sector, and
this negative externality calls for prudential
regulation.

The regulator can pull the following three levers:
capital (equity funding) requirements, liquidity
requirements, and regulation of scope (restric-
tions on activities or asset holdings).

Although the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd—
Frank) uses all three levers, the Financial
CHOICE Act, the recent sequence of US
Treasury reports, and the Economic Growth,
Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection
(EGRRCP) Act all reduce the strength of finan-
cial regulation, which is a concern.

Dodd-Frank addressed systemic risk by increas-
ing capital and liquidity requirements for banks;
establishing the Financial Stability Oversight
Council to focus on containing systemic risk,
including the designation of systemically impor-
tant financial institutions (SIFIs); introducing
stress tests and resolution plans for SIFIs; and
creating a resolution authority for failing SIFIs.

The Dodd-Frank approach is more burden-
some than necessary, imposing rules that tend
to reduce competition and restrict innovation.

As an alternative, the CHOICE Act trades off
higher capital requirements against an exemp-
tion from much of the Dodd—Frank regulation.
If the goal is to reduce systemic risk, higher
capital requirements can substitute for other
regulatory interventions, such as regulation of
scope. Capital regulation, however, requires the
regulator to accurately measure the firm's lever-
age and risk. Large, complex, and highly inter-
connected intermediaries need to be subject
to Dodd-Frank’s systemic regulations because
accurately measuring these banks’ risk and
leverage is difficult.

One way to simultaneously capture the banking
system’s risk and leverage is through stress tests.
Rather than reducing the frequency or elimi-
nating stress tests altogether, as CHOICE and
EGRRCP do, stress tests should be expanded to
cover a larger number of midsize banks.

Importantly, Dodd-Frank specifies a risk-
weighted capital requirement to control exces-
sive risk taking. A capital requirement based
solely on the leverage ratio motivates a bank to
load up on the riskiest assets because these are
treated the same as the safest assets. Using both
a simple leverage and a risk-weighted capital
ratio alleviates this problem.

SIFIs need to be subject to enhanced regula-
tion because they will be treated differently in
a financial crisis. That is why it’s a bad idea to
increase the standard for designating non-bank

CFA Institute Research Foundation | 9


DEREGULATING WALL STREET

SIFls. It is also crucial that SIFIs supply resolu-
tion plans. Unfortunately, EGRRCP dropped the
living will requirement for banks with less than
$250 billion in assets.

Dodd-Frank also introduced regulations of
scope. These regulations include the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, which deals with
predatory lending practices; new underwrit-
ing standards; rules for clearing of derivatives
transactions; and the Volcker Rule (VR). Rather
than addressing risk directly, the VR essentially

10 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

restricts banks from proprietary trading and
limits banks’ connections with hedge funds
and private equity funds. It is difficult to defend
the VR because its prohibitions are not closely
aligned with risk. Another concern is cost. A
cost-benefit analysis would be useful to com-
pare the VR’s efficiency with that of other regu-
latory tools. The goal should be to select those
tools that achieve the biggest bang (systemic
risk reduction) for the buck.


MORTGAGE-DEFAULT RESEARCH AND
THE RECENT FORECLOSURE CRISIS

Presented by Christopher L. Foote and Paul S. Willen

Summarized by Luis Garcia-Feijoo, CFA, CIPM

The foreclosure crisis associated with the 2008
financial crisis has led to a surge in academic
research on mortgage default. Before the crisis,
however, researchers had already made substan-
tial progress to model default. A central concept
was equity, because borrowers with negative
equity are more likely to default. In the 1990s,
option-pricing theory was used to show that,
even with negative equity, rational borrow-
ers may still make their payments while they
wait for house prices to increase. An alterna-
tive model, the double-trigger model of default,
emphasized adverse life events, such as job loss,
that could make continued payment difficult
even in cases of small negative equity amounts.
In light of the earlier research, scholars consid-
ered the use of loan-level data and the options
framework the standard for research on mort-
gage default.

Subsequent research, however, gave rise to new
questions. For example, options-based models
can explain why a borrower with negative equity
of 10%-20% would continue to make mortgage
payments, but they cannot explain why borrow-
ers with large negative equity would choose not
to default. In response, researchers improved
empirical predictions by imposing transaction
costs that would make default less appealing
(e.g., moving costs, negative impact on credit
score, psychological stigma). The financial
crisis confirmed that transaction costs are an

important feature of real-world data, making it
particularly important to identify those costs.

A second problem with options models is that
individual characteristics matter for default.
Borrowers typically attribute default to idio-
syncratic shocks that mean loss of income (e.g.,
death or illness in the family). Double-trigger
models attribute defaults to a combination of
negative equity and an adverse shock, but these
approaches have limitations. Researchers are
working on new methods that combine insights
of the options framework with the added real-
ism of liquidity constraints.

To design the most effective response during a
crisis, policy makers need to know more pre-
cisely why defaults rise. Research indicates that
the best way to reduce foreclosures is payment
forbearance, in which the lender accepts lower
payments for a limited period. Forbearance
works well to prevent double-trigger defaults
caused by liquidity problems because the mort-
gage holder lends funds to make payments with
little reduction in the present value of the pay-
ment stream. Another loss-mitigation policy
is principal reduction, but this policy does not
work as well because of lenders’ inability to
identify the likely default risks among the pool
of negative equity borrowers. Empirical studies
support the notion that payment reduction is an
effective way to reduce default.

MORTGAGE-DEFAULT RESEARCH AND THE RECENT FORECLOSURE CRISIS

Policy makers’ new rules following the crisis are
intended to prevent future problems. The rules
are based on the view that the crisis was caused
by lenders who originated mortgages that were
unaffordable either because of large interest-
rate resets from low initial teasers or because of
low initial debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. Resets
were not a serious problem, but the use of DTI
presents its own set of complications. A better
approach would be to base lending decisions on
variables correlated with the future variance of
income, such as credit scores.

12 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

Overall, the double-trigger model implies that
the affordability of mortgages (and not only
negative equity) is critical for borrowers con-
sidering default. But the importance of unfore-
castable income shocks means defaults for any
individual borrower are hard to predict and
hence hard to prevent with origination-income
restrictions. Policy responses focused on relax-
ing liquidity constraints will likely be more effec-
tive than those based on principal reductions.


THE ROLE OF HOUSING AND MORTGAGE
MARKETS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

Presented by Manuel Adelino, Antoinette Schoar, and Felipe Severino

Summarized by Luis Garcia-Feijoo, CFA, CIPM

It is well known that household debt increased
in the period leading up to the 2008 crisis. Less
understood is that credit expansion, as mea-
sured by increasing DTI ratios, affected people
at every income level. This expansion was also
closely tied to house price appreciation, particu-
larly via equity extraction refinancing. Evidence
suggests that lenders did not appropriately take
into account the risk of house prices declining,
but evidence does not support the contention
that lenders loosened lending standards, as
measured by average combined loan-to-value
(LTV) ratios (the amount of mortgage lever-
age, including second liens and equity loans). In
addition, no evidence indicates that the boom
increased the entry of marginal borrowers into
the housing market. The evidence points to a
financial market that underestimated the risk of
defaults and did not anticipate the housing bust.

Evidence shows that the increase in house prices
and collateral values, exacerbated by speculative
behavior, may have led to increases in mortgage

debt of homeowners who were trading up their
homes. Furthermore, research has found that
defaults increased the most for prime borrowers
and that their defaults were closely tied to house
price appreciation. Additionally, it appears the
fraction of loans that could have been affected
by deterioration of origination practices was
too small to have played a significant role in the
crisis. Overall, the findings are consistent with
overly optimistic homeowners who took out
mortgages against inflated house values and
defaulted when house prices dropped.

Properly diagnosing the financial crisis’s origins
is necessary to prevent similar future events. The
authors’ findings indicate the need for macro-
prudential regulation that prevents a systemic
buildup of leverage and protects against sys-
temic shocks to asset values. Research suggests
that appropriate responses include higher or
time-varying capital requirements and counter-
cyclical LTV requirements.

MEASURING THE COST OF BAILOUTS

Presented by Deborah Lucas
Summarized by Laurence B. Siegel

We review what economists know about the
bailouts surrounding the 2007-2009 global
financial crisis, inventorying the costs and ben-
eficiaries to provide useful and correct data to a
conversation that has consisted mostly of accu-
sations and conjecture.

The total “direct” cost of the bailouts was about
$500 billion, or 3.9% of the 2009 United States
GDP. This finding is in opposition to both the
accusation that the bailouts cost trillions and
the claim that a profit was made by the gov-
ernment (so that the cost was negative). Direct
costs are the government subsidies and guaran-
tees specifically related to the bailout, and they
do not include opportunity costs or the cost of
any moral hazard created.

We begin by defining a bailout. A bailout is a
value transfer from a government to a financially
distressed private entity (or, possibly, a govern-
ment program) for which a fair value insurance
premium was not previously collected and is
not expected to be collected after the fact. If the
government received securities in exchange for
the bailout, the cost of the bailout is only the
excess of the value transfer over the fair market
value of the securities received at the time.

Identifying the beneficiaries of a bailout is also
a key ingredient of this study. Beneficiaries can
include debt holders, stockholders, employees

14 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

and executives, customers, and parties insured
by the bailed-out organization.

Ex post analysis of a bailout’s cost is flawed. For
example, the claim that the bailouts produced a
“profit” of $97 billion mixes information from
different periods incorrectly. It is just as bad to
claim that all government funds put at risk dur-
ing the bailout effort were spent or lost; they
were not, and a large news organization's bail-
out cost estimate of $16.8 trillion can be safely
ignored. Only fair value estimates based on
information available at the time of a given bail-
out are economically acceptable.

The cost of mortgage guarantees, such as those
provided by the Federal Housing Administration
(FHA), is hard to assess because they are essen-
tially insurance premiums for events that may
or may not happen—so one cannot easily tell
whether the premium being charged is fair. The
fact that deep losses occurred does not mean
the premium was too low. For many years, pre-
miums were collected and losses did not occur.
It is generally agreed, however, that FHA guar-
antees are subsidized (underpriced), at a cost to
taxpayers and providing a benefit to borrowers
and builders.

A similar analysis can be applied to Troubled
Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans, student
loan guarantees, Federal Deposit Insurance


MEASURING THE COST OF BAILOUTS

Corporation coverage, and other government
guarantees of private financial arrangements.
To sum up, the fair value analysis described here
results in cost estimates of $311 billion to bail
out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $60 billion for

the FHA, and $90 billion for the TARP program,
as well as a number of miscellaneous items for a
total cost of $498 billion, of which private inves-
tors received $418 billion. A “ballpark estimate”
of the cost of all other guarantees is $60 billion.

INTERMEDIARY ASSET PRICING
AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

Presented by Zhiguo He and Arvind Krishnamurthy

Summarized by Luis Garcia-Feijéo, CFA, CIPM

The article provides an introduction to asset
pricing based on frictions in financial interme-
diaries, broadly defined to include commercial
banks, investment banks, and hedge funds. The
2008 financial crisis called into question the
classical asset pricing assumptions that inter-
mediaries are a veil and that asset prices reflect
household preferences.

Theoretically, an intermediary asset pricing
model considers a household sector and an
intermediary sector. Households delegate
investment in some intermediated assets to
intermediaries, and contracting frictions (ie.,
moral hazard, or shirking) imply such delega-
tion is not a veil. As a result, prices for the inter-
mediated assets will depend on intermediary
frictions.

An important assumption is that there is lim-
ited participation by households in some assets,
and hence there is delegation. This can be moti-
vated by lack of knowledge to invest in com-
plex assets, such as asset-backed securities, or
by infrequent assessment of consumption and
investment decisions by households (i.e., annual
rebalancing), such as in the equity markets.
Hence, intermediary asset pricing studies low-
frequency price movements and can be distin-
guished from market microstructure research.

16 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

Contracting frictions separate it from models
with heterogeneous agents.

Intermediary asset pricing implies that shocks to
intermediation should affect asset prices, espe-
cially during a financial crisis. Intermediation
shocks can be capital reductions caused by
losses or investor withdrawals or by increases
in asset complexity, which worsen contract-
ing frictions. Additionally, capital shocks have
a non-linear impact on asset prices, and the
impact depends on whether (regulatory) capi-
tal constraints bind (i.e., intermediaries cannot
raise equity capital from households).

Theoretically, frictions will affect the prices of
assets that are more intermediated, which has
implications that can be tested empirically.
Specifically, intermediation disruptions should
be associated with movement in intermedi-
ated asset prices. Furthermore, a number of
researchers have constructed an intermediary
stochastic discount factor (SDF) to show how
this factor can price asset returns. A (sufficient)
test of intermediary asset pricing requires show-
ing that the intermediary factor can explain
variation in asset returns, whereas the house-
hold factor cannot.

Empirically, evidence supports the intermedi-
ary asset pricing from research done using data


INTERMEDIARY ASSET PRICING AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

from the financial crisis. Such evidence is based
on covered interest rate parity deviations and
also comes from insurance markets, especially
related to the pricing of long-term life insur-
ance during the crisis. From a different perspec-
tive, empirical research using an intermediary
factor (SDF) also is based, for example, on the
pricing of prepayment risk in mortgage-backed

securities or broker/dealer capital ratios. This
research estimates an intermediary price of risk
that can be used to improve theoretical models.
Further research is needed, however, to better
understand which types of intermediaries and
financial frictions are most relevant to under-
standing asset prices.

LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE, AND REGULATION
10 YEARS AFTER THE GLOBAL

FINANCIAL CRISIS

Presented by Tobias Adrian, John Kiff, and Hyun Song Shin

Summarized by Luis Garcia-Feijoo, CFA, CIPM

Bank leverage has declined around the world
since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. It
would be simplistic, however, to attribute dele-
veraging to increased banking regulation fol-
lowing the crisis.

Because banks are financial intermediaries,
bank capital plays a key role for overall lending.
Banks that are well capitalized can lend more of
their own funds and can also borrow more and
on better terms. For better-capitalized banks,
the lower funding cost translates into greater
intermediation activity.

Currently, for typical levels of bank leverage,
evidence suggests that banks could retain more
of their profits to build capital, thereby reducing
their cost of equity funding.

Additionally, bank leverage is influenced by the
combination of perceived creditworthiness of
the intermediary as a borrower and how tight
overall credit conditions are in the financial sys-
tem. Bank leverage exhibits cyclical variations.
If funding liquidity is ample, even thinly capi-
talized banks can borrow on easy terms. When
conditions tighten, banks are likely to delever-
age and shrink lending, with pernicious conse-
quences for the real economy.

Evidence indicates that, rather than having been
caused by increased regulation, the leverage

18 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

collapse following the crisis reflected a combi-
nation of reduced expected returns, conserva-
tive risk management, the diminished role of
securitization, and the growth of non-bank
lending and market making.

Regulatory reforms following the crisis can be
grouped around four objectives:

1. Improve financial system resilience in case
of stress, including the following areas: capi-
tal ratios relative to risk-weighted assets;
leverage ratios; liquidity and funding ratios;
stress tests; central clearing counterpar-
ties for standardized derivatives contracts;
and reforms of the shadow banking sec-
tor, such as those affecting money market
funds, securitization, or interconnected-
ness between the banking and non-banking
sectors

2. Contain risk buildup in the financial system,
including the following areas: countercycli-
cal buffers requiring banks to hold addi-
tional capital in times of excessive credit
growth and risk; development of new tools
to assess systemic risk, such as conditional
VaR (value at risk); and stronger constraints
on interconnectedness between SIBs (sys-
tematically important banks)


LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE, AND REGULATION 10 YEARS AFTER THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS

3. Strengthen policy and supervision of the
financial system, including the following: a
focus on understanding the financial sector
as a system and new institutional macropru-
dential frameworks to strengthen oversight
of systemic risk

4. Limit moral hazard and lower failure costs,
including the following areas: strong crisis
management arrangements for recovery or
orderly resolution of failing firms without

spillovers for financial stability and capital
surcharges for SIBs

Regulatory reform should be evaluated in terms
of overall benefits to the financial system and
wider economy rather than only with respect
to the narrow interests of financial market
participants. Evidence shows that regulations
have made the financial system safer, but addi-
tional research is needed on their unintended
consequences.

SYSTEMIC RISK 10 YEARS LATER

Presented by Robert Engle
Summarized by Laurence B. Siegel

The 2007-2009 global financial crisis was related
to excessive credit growth. Credit growth is
excessive if the financial sector has insufficient
capital to cover market value losses in a down-
turn. At the end of a long economic expansion,
risky credit is issued increasingly. If the holders
of these credits are leveraged, their equity turns
negative and a credit boom goes bust.

To understand financial crises, one can study
the risks posed by undercapitalization of finan-
cial firms. As the business cycle peaks, such
firms are progressively more exposed to the risk
of holding deteriorating credits with declin-
ing collateral quality while also being lever-
aged. The measure called SRISK (for systematic
risk), developed by the Volatility Laboratory at
New York University, captures this phenom-
enon. SRISK uses global equity prices (the price
of an exchange-traded fund based on the MSCI
ACW/I) as a proxy for market stress.

This method is used to forecast the betas of
financial firms. Interestingly, the firm betas
reflect the characteristics of each firm. In the
Great Recession, the betas of Bank of America
and Citigroup rose to 3 and 4, respectively,
whereas the betas of both Goldman Sachs and
BNP Paribas did not move much at all. The lat-
ter two companies were not involved in the sub-
prime mortgage business.

20 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

The risks of undercapitalized firms then are
aggregated to the country level, with no netting
of fully capitalized firms, because capital from
these prudent firms is not immediately available
to recapitalize the weak firms. The country risk
estimates are aggregated to form a world risk
estimate, which is as high now as it was in 2008.
We estimate that about $4 trillion of capital
would be needed to recapitalize all the financial
firms in the world. European and Asian banks
currently pose more risk than US banks.

To ascertain the probability of a financial crisis,
one must also measure risk capacity—that is, the
financial system’s ability to withstand risk posed
by undercapitalized institutions. Interestingly,
despite currently large amounts of risk in some
such institutions, the probability of a US finan-
cial crisis is as low as at any time in this century,
around 2% or 3%, compared with between 85%
and 95% (depending on the model) at the time
of the global financial crisis. Risk capacity in a
country is related to the level of GDP, the mar-
ket value of financial firms’ equity, and the total
assets of financial firms. For these reasons, sys-
temic risk has been reduced dramatically from
the high levels experienced during the financial
crisis.


REGULATORY REFORM

Presented by Andrew Metrick and June Rhee

Summarized by Luis Garcia-Feijéo, CFA, CIPM

Following the global financial crisis (GFC),
major regulatory reforms have ensued around
the prevention and management of financial
crises (i.e., systemic risk). In 2010, the new
Basel III framework addressed three main
issues: capital inadequacy, insufficient liquidity,
and financial system interconnectedness. In the
United States, the 2010 Dodd—Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act included
systemic risk elements, such as the estab-
lishment of the Financial Stability Oversight
Council. The European Union introduced the
European System of Financial Supervision in
2011 and the EU banking union in 2012. In the
United Kingdom, the 2013 Financial Services
Act reformed the regulatory structure.

Post-GFC reforms can be organized into three
groups: preventative powers, emergency pow-
ers, and restructuring powers. The main effect
of reforms has been to shift power from the sec-
ond group into the first and third groups.

Three important prevention topics are liquidity
regulation, central clearing, and shadow bank-
ing. Liquidity rules are paradoxical because
they target an essential maturity transformation
function of banks. Further research is needed to
understand the design and impact of these new
rules. Central counterparties (CCPs) poten-
tially can remedy the problems of opacity and

bankruptcy inefficiency associated with swaps’
OTC activity. Because the industry has no prior
experience with a shift of this magnitude from
OTC activity into CCPs, many questions remain.

A major concern with liquidity regulation, cen-
tral clearing, and other prevention topics is that
they involve a migration to shadow banking
(money market mutual funds, securitization,
asset-backed commercial papers, and repos). No
effective regulation manages this migration, and
further research is needed.

Two major types of emergency measures in
which legal authority changed the most in post-
GFC reforms include the lender of last resort
(LOLR) and broad-based guarantees. Research
is needed on key aspects of LOLR measures,
such as who can borrow during a panic, under
what collateral rules can they borrow, and at
what rates. Any appropriate answer must bal-
ance the potential short-term stigma of borrow-
ing against long-term moral hazard problems.
Regarding guarantees, research on the evalu-
ation of alternative guarantee plans and on
changes to guarantee authority is needed.

Rules around the resolution and restructuring
process changed significantly after the GFC. For
empirical researchers, the challenge is that these
rules are complex and untested.

CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

Moderator: Stanley Fischer

Panel: Ben Bernanke, Mervyn King, and Jean-Claude Trichet

Summarized by Laurence B. Siegel?

A remarkable group of central bankers met
at New York University on 9 November 2018
to discuss the state of affairs 10 years after
the great financial meltdown in the autumn
of 2008. In the humble position of moderator
was Stanley Fischer, the former vice-chair of
the Federal Reserve, who would have been the
featured speaker in practically any other gather-
ing on Earth. The principal speakers were Ben
Bernanke, who needs no introduction (so he
will get none), former Bank of England gover-
nor Lord Mervyn King, and former European
Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet.

WHAT DID YOU LEARN,
AND WHAT WOULD YOU
DO DIFFERENTLY?

Fischer began by asking the bankers what they
learned from their experience as the head of one
of the great central banks and what they would
do differently if they faced a similar challenge
today.

Ben Bernanke's Response

Bernanke, the first to respond, made three main
points:

1. The thing that he and other central bank-
ers did not see coming was the extent of
“run vulnerability” throughout the modern
financial system. (An institution is vulner-
able to “runs” when depositors, creditors, or
other liability holders think they have to be
the first to make a claim on an insufficient
asset pool or they will not get their share.)

2. “Without the pervasive panic, we would
not have had nearly so bad an economic
outcome as we did.” In other words, panic
during the crisis was one cause of the depth
of the economic decline and the failure to
recover more quickly.

3. “Where I remain concerned,’ Bernanke said,
“js in terms of the firefighting tools.”

Let us examine each of these points in more
detail.

Run vulnerability

Central bankers’ lack of ability to forecast the
crisis, Bernanke said, can be attributed to several
factors. First, the bankers “saw housing prices
very high relative to rents” but “had hoped that
would correct in a more gradual way.’ Second,
risk premiums were low, meaning that the


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

reward for taking various kinds of risks—not
only equity risk, but the many fixed-income
risks that permeate the financial system—was
unusually small. Alan Greenspan had previously
talked about this dynamic in one of his valedic-
tory speeches, referring to costs that can arise
from risk premiums being low.

Furthermore, Bernanke said, central bankers
did not have a full picture of how the modern
financial system, based on the existence of com-
plex securities (some of them held using large
amounts of leverage), created new run vulner-
abilities. “We saw the run . . . on commercial
paper, a run on money market funds, collateral
runs, repo [i.e., repurchase agreement] runs,
so [the phenomenon of runs] was really quite
generalized. The conceptual problem was that,
in almost all these cases, the short-term liabil-
ity that was being run was collateralized” It is
unusual, and frankly somewhat illogical, for
liabilities that are properly collateralized to be
subject to runs. Of course, this logic presumes
that the collateral is good and is being accu-
rately valued.

“Take repo, for example,’ Bernanke said. “It’s
collateralized and backed by generally liquid
securities, so [we thought it unlikely] that we
would see runs in those markets. Nevertheless
it turned out that, as the crisis worsened and as
lenders became worried about the liquidities
of secondary markets and their own ability to
dispose of financial assets in a timely and effi-
cient way, the easiest thing for them to do was
to run”—that is, to sell them at any price.

The panic and the depth
of the downturn

Regarding Bernanke's claim that the pervasive-
ness of the panic exacerbated the downturn, he

said, “I'll give you two pieces of evidence. The
first one has to do with the forecasts being made
by standard macro models before the crisis.
Even in scenarios that assume declines in house
prices that were as large or larger than actually
happened, the macro models [didn’t forecast] an
unemployment rate above 7%.

“Indicators of the panic,’ Bernanke continued,
“such as the spread between the LIBOR rate and
the short-term interest rate or OIS [overnight
indexed swap] rate, were much better forecast-
ers of the real economy than were . . . house
prices. Because the panic was so central in the
United States, I think that we have to evaluate
the regulatory changes that have been under-
taken since then, at least in part in terms of how
they guard us against a future panic”

Bernanke ended this section of his comments
ona hopeful note. He said, “I think that in terms
of reducing the risk of a panic occurring and
reducing the vulnerability of the system, we've
made a lot of progress.” Bernanke described
work by Andrew Metrick and Robert Engle
showing that some of the risks have decreased.
The shadow banking sector is smaller, the level
of reliance on short-term funding is down, and
there is more capital and less leverage at work.

Firefighting tools

In the United States, Bernanke indicated, “the
lending tools—the lender-of-last-resort author-
ities at the Fed—were constrained after the cri-
sis, and I fear that they are not fully adequate”
These tools continue to be constrained, he said.
But he is encouraged by some of the develop-
ments “in terms of the resolution authority, the
liquidation authority, which I think will be very
helpful”

CFA Institute Research Foundation | 23


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

Bernanke summary and
discussion questions

Summing up, Bernanke indicated that cen-
tral bankers were “late in understanding that
this [panic] was going to happen.’ It took them
a while, in 2007, to see its extent. Once they
understood what it was, he said, “we reacted
aggressively with lending and ultimately with
capital and guarantees to help stabilize the sys-
tem.” He concluded, “I think we were successful
in stabilizing the system”

Bernanke then tossed out questions for dis-
cussion. Recognizing that what he and his col-
leagues did was unpopular, he asked:

e¢ Was that because of inadequate communi-
cation on their part?

¢ Or, was it because our political system is
not set up in a way to appropriately address
major financial crises and ways of resolving
them?

“Would it have been better,’ he wondered, “if we
had more pieces in place before the crisis?” He
added, “That’s what I actually think .. . that if we
had had something more like a Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation for the shadow banking
sector, we would have been much better placed
both economically and politically.’

Finally, he indicated that “if there could have
been differences in terms of response, it would
have been in the communication and the poli-
tics” They would have made these aspects “a
much bigger part” of their response.

Mervyn King's Response

King began by commenting, “I share Ben’s view
that the essence of this was a run on short-term
debt liabilities. The impact on the real economy
derived from the existence of the run, and [it

24 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

was] not just within [one] country. There was
a global downturn, and it reflected a change in
narrative about how much confidence one could
place in the United States and therefore, by
extension, other financial systems.”

The question King said he would like to add to
Bernanke’s main points is, “Why was there a
run in the first place?”

King, like Bernanke, made three main points.

Undercapitalization of the
banking system

First, King said, the banking system was under-
capitalized. “At the bank we felt pretty early on,
by December 2007 or January 2008, that the
loss of confidence [that] markets showed in the
banking system, as reflected in the waxing and
waning of the LIBOR/OIS spread, was never
going to be dealt with satisfactorily without a
recapitalization of the banking system.

“The difficulty with that, of course,’ he contin-
ued, “is that there is no objective measure of
the amount of capital that you need in order to
maintain confidence . . . so that the rest of the
system [will] be willing to lend to banks. The
lender-of-last-resort framework that we thought
we inherited from the past to extend emergency
liquidity was inadequate to cope with the mod-
ern banking system.”

King reminded us that “we all know Bagehot’s
dictum: ‘Lend freely, at a penalty rate against
good collateral’ All three aspects of that failed in
2008. ‘Lend freely’ failed because of stigma, and
I think we were not conscious of how important
that was.’ He reflected, “I think the 1914 epi-
sode, the major financial crisis at the beginning
of the First World War, was . . . overshadowed
by the actual [war] itself, but nevertheless it was
a big financial crisis in which, in the run-up to


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

it, stigma had played a role, and that was rather
forgotten.’ By “stigma,” King was likely referring
to the political undesirability of transferring
public funds to institutions that were perceived
to have mismanaged their affairs.

According to King, Bagehot's penalty rate “failed
because it was time inconsistent. It’s fine to say
in advance you're going to impose a penalty rate,
[but] when you actually get to the crisis and
banks need the money, there’s not much incen-
tive to impose the penalty rate.”

‘The third part of the Bagehot rule, “against good
collateral,’ failed because “there wasn’t any good
collateral.” Ouch.

King then commented about the politics of how
to deal with these problems. When it came to
recapitalizing the banks, politicians created
the biggest obstacle. “Everything that was done
where politicians had knowledge of it;’ King
said, “somehow managed to be leaked to the
press, which made actually conducting many of
these operations extraordinarily difficult”

Jean-Claude Trichet's Response

Trichet’s initial response was brief. “The
[European Central Bank] didn’t have a lack of
tools,’ he said. “I have the memory,’ he contin-
ued, “of a meeting we had confidentially with
the banks at the . .. beginning of 2007 where .. .
even one of the bankers [Charles Prince, CEO
of Citigroup] was saying, ‘I know that what we
do is bizarre, but when the music plays, I cannot
help but stand up and dance?

“With the growing interconnectedness of the
markets with IT and globalization,’ Trichet said,
“the herd was forming in half a day. The same
type of run, which has happened before, is hap-
pening much faster.’ He summed up by saying
that in future challenges, “we have to respond

extremely quickly and boldly” Trichet cautioned
that there will be no time to ask politicians to
make decisions, because they will be incapable
of deciding.

CONTAGION

Stanley Fischer then noted, “One of the most
interesting aspects of this crisis in historical
terms was the unbelievable speed of transmis-
sion to Asia. Within two months, I think exports
[by] some of the leading exporters were down
about 50%.”

Mervyn King's Response

King was the first to respond. He said, “I was
very struck, in the crisis, that our central bank
colleagues from not just Asia but also Latin
America would ring up and basically say, ‘We
haven't had a banking crisis in our country, but
nevertheless we're seeing a dramatic drop off the
cliff in domestic spending—why is this happen-
ing?” King thought there was a major change
for the worse in sentiment among all investors
and decision makers, but “once you go just six
to nine months down the road after that, [peo-
ple] in most of the emerging market countries
realized they hadn't had a banking crisis. They
weren't so badly affected” Emerging market
countries, King concluded, were the ones that
began to lead the world out of recession.

Jean-Claude Trichet's Response

Trichet found it “humiliating” that the advanced
economies were “the epicenter of the . . . cri-
sis.” The fact that any large amount of invest-
ment in the rich countries was “interrupted
because of the uncertainty of the situation,’
combined with the fact that everybody wanted
to maximize liquidity and minimize risk in a

CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

hurry, created a situation in which “the baton
passed from G-7 to the G—-20” This is a striking
change. In addition to the G-7 group of tradi-
tionally developed countries, the G-20 includes
the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) as
well as Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and South Korea.*

Ben Bernanke's Response

It would have been surprising if Bernanke's
response was brief. It wasn’t particularly.

“You hear this naive comment sometimes,’ he
said, about “how many firms in a given quarter
are actually seeking new credit . . . and [that]
those are the ones which were affected by this
shock to credit supply. I think that’s exactly the
wrong way to think about it”

Bernanke continued, “I think what happened,
as Mervyn and Jean-Claude were both indicat-
ing, is that there was this massive surge of fear,
liquidity preference, precautionary savings, a
desire to husband liquidity—for example, firms
that didn’t have an immediate need for credit
drew down their credit lines as far as they could
just to have as much cash as possible. This cre-
ated a tremendous impact on the real economy
as, for example, firms stopped hiring because
they wanted to conserve the costs of employ-
ment. ... [T]his had a global effect.”

He then added that trade was “killed” by the
crisis.

The Federal Reserve, Bernanke said, was “disad-
vantaged,’ echoing a theme he developed earlier.
“The Federal Reserve has two limited authori-
ties in terms of what it can buy, who it can lend
to—we were severely disadvantaged by the fact
The European Union is separately a member of the G-20,
and Australia (which is not in the G—7 but is a historically

developed country) is also a member, rounding out the list
of 20.

that we needed to invoke emergency powers to
lend to anybody that wasn’t a commercial bank,
whereas the [European Central Bank], you
know, could lend to any financial institution”

Bernanke emphasized that the Fed’s role was
“in one way very asymmetric, [in] that we were
the producers of dollars. In a period of intense
crisis, [the US dollar] is the key currency. One
of the first things that we did in 2007 was to set
up, ultimately, 14 swap lines with foreign central
banks, essentially making sure that the foreign
central banks . . . had access to dollars, which
they could then on-lend to their domestic finan-
cial institutions. We felt that was essential to
stabilize dollar funding markets and therefore
important for the US economy as well as for the
global economy?’

Bernanke said that, as he recalled, the Fed ended
up doing swaps with four emerging markets:
Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea. The
choice of markets was based on criteria such as
the extent and depth of the market, as well as
their economic importance to the United States.

Mervyn King's Additional

Comments

King then added, “The one thing that became
very apparent in the crisis was that the major
central banks who work together closely on a
range of things and meet each other have real
trust in each other, which does not depend on
formal agreements.”

For example, on 11 September 2001, Alan
Greenspan was stuck in Europe, so Roger
Ferguson, who was second in command [at
the Fed], was in charge. Banks deal with their
opposite number, so Ferguson dealt with King,
who was then second in command at the Bank
of England, instead of then-governor Eddie
George. “The only basis on which that could


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

have been done and worked,” said Bernanke,
“was personal trust.”

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY
SYSTEM

Stanley Fischer then asked: What changes would
you like to see in the new regulatory system that
emerges from the crisis?

Jean-Claude Trichet's Response

Trichet began on an optimistic note: “What we
did for the banks in general has been quite well
done” What he still finds dangerous is that herd
behavior can create runs in public markets just
as it can for banks.

“Public and private leverage,’ Trichet pointed
out, “has continued to augment after the cri-
sis as it did before the crisis. If you [calculate]
public debt outstanding plus private debt out-
standing as a percentage of global GDP, you
see that this indicator had [grown by] some-
thing like 25% of global GDP over the period
from, say, 2007-2008 to 2016, according to the
International Monetary Fund. So this . . . signals
something, not necessarily in any particular
country but at the global level, that we [have to
be aware of]?

Mervyn King's Response

King initially addressed the question of how the
Bank of England functioned as a lender of last
resort: “There are no limits on the identity of
potential recipients of Bank of England support.
We can lend to whomever we want either in
the financial sector or outside it. The only thing
is that we now have an agreed Memorandum
of Understanding between the bank and the
Treasury on behalf of the government, which I
signed with George Osborne. It sets down the

fact that the Treasury has to give approval to
any specific lender-of-last-resort operation. I
think that’s sensible because in the end, it’s the
Treasury that is going to underwrite the fiscal
risk” of such lending.

King then answered Fischer's question: “You
have to have a framework in which the political
side . . . gives agreement. You can do it in gen-
eral terms ex ante or . . . by being involved in
the particular operations, but in the end, [poli-
ticians] have to give indemnity to the central
bank for carrying out an operation”

Understanding the maturity
mismatch of bank balance
sheets

King continued, “I think that the system does
need to be redesigned, somewhat along the lines
of my proposal” in which “maturity transfor-
mation, whether in the formal banking system
or outside it, is an important part of the credit
process.”

Maturity transformation is the process by which
banks and other organizations borrow short
term and lend long term. This practice is nor-
mal, and a source of profit for those institutions,
but it is laden with interest rate risk, especially
if the process is leveraged—that is, if the insti-
tution does not have enough capital to protect
it from fluctuations in asset and liability val-
ues. King appears to mean that the amount of
interest rate risk taken by a financial institution
should be crucial in determining the institu-
tion’s credit quality.

“If there’s too much maturity transformation,
he said, “then it can cause the risk of a crisis and,
just as Ben [Bernanke] said, it’s the panic that
can have enormously costly economic repercus-
sions. So you want a positive tax on the degree

CFA Institute Research Foundation | 27


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

of maturity transformation. That means looking
at both the asset and the liability side of the bal-
ance sheet together. One of the weaknesses of
[the] Basel [regulatory framework for banks],
all the way through, has been that initially it
focused only on the asset side”

Summary of Mervyn King's
statement

To sum up, King said, we need to focus on the
aspects of the financial system that can gener-
ate a run. “We didn’t have enough capital in
the banking system; we didn’t have a resolution
process that would deal with bigger banks; and,
most important, we didn’t have the political
buy-in to say that here’s a crisis we have thought
through in advance, we know how we might
deal with it, and we're broadly comfortable with
the framework that’s being used”

Ben Bernanke's Response

Bernanke commented, “One theme I'd like
people to take away is that the differences in
the powers of different central banks are really
substantial. So Mervyn could lend to anybody,
presumably, including his gardener.

“It’s a concern to me,’ he continued, “that we
don’t have in the United States a lender-of-
last-resort authority that’s adequate—although,
interestingly, there is one part of our system
that actually works very well. That is the way
the FDIC deals with failing commercial banks.
It's ironic that the United States is the country
where the [central bank] has limited lending
authority but also the biggest nonbank credit
markets.”

Jean-Claude Trichet's Response

To Fischer’s question, Trichet responded,
“What worries me most is that macroeconomic

28 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

policies are not optimal . . . the world over—
certainly not optimal in the advanced econo-
mies, but also in the emerging economies.’ He
said that is likely to be the reason we have the
augmentation of leverage that has already been
mentioned and that is now understood as one of
the major vulnerabilities of the global economy.
“I think we have to do something,” Trichet said,
“and, in my opinion, it is quite urgent because
we have to change the balance between equity
and debt in practically all economies, emerging
or advanced.”

MORAL HAZARD

Stanley Fischer then asked, “How large should
the role of moral hazard be in designing
facilities?”

Ben Bernanke's Response

Bernanke replied, “The fear of moral hazard has
led Congress to say, ‘We're not going to make
any preparation for this contingency because
we don’t want to give the [impression] that we
would in fact intervene: But, of course, if things
get bad enough, some future government will
intervene.”

So, Bernanke said, we would be better off “set-
ting up an ex ante structure [that] lays out the
rules and eliminates some of the uncertainty
and delay and political costs.” And, second, we
must make it clear that “if you're an individual
firm that’s making bad decisions, you're not
going to be protected except in the event of a
systemic crisis.” Third, he said it was “a myth
that American banks were ‘bailed out’ and
held harmless during the crisis. It’s true that
the creditors were protected, but the equity
holders, the management and so on, were very
badly hurt, even when their banks received
capital.”


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

So, Bernanke’s recommendation is to design a
structure, in advance, in which the conditions
for an intervention are made clear. Defining “the
rights of individual stakeholders ... , as we do
now with deposit insurance, would ex ante limit
some of the moral hazard.

“I think it’s a solvable problem,’ he concluded.

Mervyn King's Response
to Ben Bernanke

Reacting to Bernanke's comments, King said
that he “never found ambiguity very construc-
tive.’ It is much better, he said, to “set down a
clear ex ante framework within which opera-
tions can be conducted and the rules that will
govern it. You then get political buy-in to [the
framework]. The politicians don’t have to say we
agree with every individual action that’s taken,
and they can hold people accountable ex post?

King concluded, “You’ve got to have a consid-
eration of moral hazard when you design the
scheme, but merely mentioning the word does
not mean that you can’t do something at all” In
other words, he seemed to agree with Bernanke
that moral hazard is a design problem to be
solved, not an insurmountable obstacle to good
policy.

Jean-Claude Trichet's Response

Trichet said that “the euro area is transforming
itself under the pressure of the crisis. We had
two new treaties. We had the banking union,
which is of course a major structural reform that
was totally unexpected before the crisis but that
was overdue in light of it”

He also commented that, to stave off future
crises, it is necessary to “try to detach the cred-
itworthiness of the bank from the creditworthi-
ness of the nation.”

Finally, he said that creating a special entity that
is not the central bank for guaranteeing depos-
its is essential and that the FDIC in the United
States is the correct model.

Audience Question to Bernanke
on Moral Hazard

An audience member asked, “Ben, do you still
hold the view that, if the crisis had a single les-
son, it is that ‘too big to fail’ must be ended?
How much progress do you think we’ve made
in terms of attacking that problem, and why is
there such a dearth of interest in the topic from
academia?”

Ben Bernanke's Response

“You have to make it plausible,’ Bernanke replied,
“that you could have a [financial institution] fail-
ure that wouldn't bring down the system, right?
That’s the essence of the orderly liquidation
authority, Title 2 of Dodd—Frank, the ‘living wills’
I've had a number of briefings from the FDIC and
the Fed on progress in that area, and I’m a little
more optimistic about it than some.

“It’s certainly true,’ Bernanke continued, “that
[this idea] hasn’t been tested, and it would not
be easy, particularly for a large multinational
firm with many overseers. But I do feel that
what's there is more credible and that the living
wills have . . . put us in a better position relative
to where we were with the ad hoc weekend res-
cues of the crisis period”

Stanley Fischer then said that the process of
closing a bank is not something he would want
to get into.

Bernanke replied, “No; that’s what I was saying.
That is why the moral hazard concern is some-
what overstated. But, also at the same time, if
you really can’t allow a large firm to fail, then

CFA Institute Research Foundation | 29


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

you're in a situation where, in a crisis, every
large firm is a potential time bomb. You know
that extraordinary, politically unpopular, and
economically undesirable steps have to be taken
to protect them. Free laissez-faire is the right
thing, [so failure must be an acceptable out-
come for a business], but I think it needs to be
a guided and organized failure. I think it can be
done in a way that reduces the implications for
the broader system.”

ADDITIONAL ISSUES

Central Bank Independence

An audience member asked to what extent
central bank independence can actually be reit-
erated or preserved in an era of more interven-
tionist politics.

Jean-Claude Trichet replied that “independence
must function in both directions.”

Ben Bernanke said, “It’s important to define
what independence means. It doesn’t mean, for
example, that the central bank can coordinate or
cooperate with the fiscal authorities as we [did]
during the crisis, which was appropriate. It also
doesn’t mean that the central bank gets to set its
own objectives. Congress tells the Fed to [seek]
price stability and maximum employment and,
in general, the government will give the pow-
ers and the framework [for the Fed to do that],
but it seems instrumentally valuable for central
banks to have what's called instrument indepen-
dence ability:

Instrument independence is the authority to
decide what monetary instruments to use. It
differs from goal independence, which is the
authority to decide what to use the monetary

30 | CFA Institute Research Foundation

instruments for. In the United States, the Fed
does not have goal independence.

Risks Caused by Pension
Guarantees

Zvi Bodie, an audience member and Boston
University professor of finance, commented,
“I’m even willing to go so far as to say what the
first warning is going to be, and it will be the
bankruptcy of the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation”

King responded, “I share your concern that
there could be an economic crisis resulting
across the world [because of] inadequate pen-
sion provision and [the fact that] we've made
promises to people [that] the potential suppli-
ers of pensions may not be able to meet. I think
this is somewhat different in character from the
financial system crises that we've been discuss-
ing—the runs—the solution to which has to
come from central banks.

“But,” King continued, “I think the question
of pensions is a much wider issue. It’s a very
important one, I agree—but . . . it inevitably
involves difficult political judgments and deci-
sions, and that goes beyond the remit of cen-
tral bank governors, independent though we
may have been.”

RECAPS AND CLOSING NOTE

Ben Bernanke did not recapitulate his comments.

Recap from Mervyn King
King closed by saying, “I think we are in a bet-

ter position. Banks do have more loss-absorbing
capacity. A byproduct of quantitative easing is


CENTRAL BANKER ROUNDTABLE

that the system as a whole has a lot more liquid-
ity than before.

“Resolution, King continued, “has been
improved everywhere; that’s a great help. My big
worry would be that the resolution framework,
which might work smoothly on paper, might
not survive the interest of the White House or
Number 10 Downing Street or someone in the
European Commission. [In other words,] politi-
cians would try to intervene because they would
say, ‘None of us really knows the possible con-
tagion effect of allowing a large institution to go
through this resolution process?

“If we have a proper ex ante framework for
central banks dealing with that [concern],” he
said, “then I think the risk of it is much dimin-
ished. What I take away is the complementar-
ity between the efforts that have been made
to increase the amount of capital in banks to
improve their liquidity position (though, as
I said, more needs to be done on that front),
on the resolution framework, and on interna-
tional cooperation between central banks and
regulators.”

King concluded, “The trouble is that much of
this [improvement] will fade as people age and
younger people who don’t remember the crisis
come in to run institutions, but that’s why put-
ting things down and having an ex ante frame-
work is important.”

Recap from Jean-Claude Trichet

Trichet remarked, “I said already that it was
quite worrying when I look at some indicators
of fragility at the global level and at the level
of many countries. One major difficulty I see
for some central banks, and maybe all central
banks of the advanced economies, is that in case
we have a recession, or in case we have to cope
with [some other] kind of dramatic event, we
have to be fully aware that we will have to utilize
ammunitions and that they are very meager at
the moment.”

Closing Remark by Stanley

Fischer

Stanley Fischer remarked that “the cost of this
very difficult crisis was much less than [that of]
the Great Depression. [The] unemployment rate
reached 10% [in the crisis of 2008]; it reached
25% in the Great Depression. That's enough to
tell you this was a very successful operation”

This appraisal is valid only if the degree of finan-
cial distress that produced the Great Depression
was actually replicated in 2007-2009. It is hard
to see how one should assess that claim. Fischer
and the other central bankers seem to hold that
view, however, and perhaps we should take seri-
ously the idea that a second Great Depression
was avoided through the actions discussed in
this Roundtable.
